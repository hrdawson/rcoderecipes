Hi there! This is a repository for helpful R stats code written by Hilary Rose. Most of it comes with explanations of varying depth, some of it even comes with videos. 

I've written this code to share things that other people may find useful. I have not rigorously tested it and do not promise it will be trouble free. Feel free to report issues as you find them, especially if you have a suggested correction. Credit is appreciated where appropriate.

Thanks and good luck!
